# SVT Robotics demo app with Bootstrap HTML5 CSS3 Javascript EXAMPLE project

## A funtional EXAMPLE project written in Javascript to create a table which has sortable columns and can filter by robot ID

This project is an example showing how to obtain data from an API with Axios and use javascript to structure and place data within the HTML structure. The sample code shows how to do the following:

* Obtain data from an API endpoint using Axios
* Loop through the data response and structure it in a uniform way
* Append the data to the table
* Sort the data ascending and descending within each column
* Filter the ID column by user input

## How to run this example Javascript project

The easiest way to see how this project works is to:

1. Download the VS Code IDE
2. Within VS Code install the Live Server plugin by Ritwick Dey
3. Within this Github repository click the "Code" button to clone the repository
4. Select HTTPS and make sure to copy the URL
5. Open a terminal window and change directory into the desired location where you would like to clone the repository
6. In the terminal window type the following command: git clone https://... (paste in the copied url after git clone)
7. Change directory into the folder of the cloned respository
8. Open the index.html file
9. Right click within the file and select "Open with Live Server"
10. The app should be opened within a window of your default browser running on localhost http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html

## Future goals for the example project

Turn the app into a mock e-commerce site where users can create an account and buy robots. The user would be able to login and view the robots which they have purchased and leave comments about their items as well as read comments from other users about their robots. 

Other improvemnets would be adding photos for all robots and creating a photo grid. The grid would display the details of the robot within a modal containing its picture and would also popup when the picture is clicked. 

A toggle would be created to switch back and forth between the table view and grid view.

The app would need a navabar containg ways for the user to easily navigate between account features.
